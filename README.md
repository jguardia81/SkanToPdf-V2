# SkanToPdf-V2
Version 2 of previous project
This little soft allows to get some documents from your scanner and put them in a pdf file, that you can save or send by email.
By default scan zones are deactivated and dpi is set to 100 so that produced pdf files are smaller. It works on linux on Kde 
Framwork 5. I'm developping on Kde Neon with plasma as my default desktop. Fill free to copy, share, improve ... It's GPL V3.0
For french users, do not forget to copy the qm file in the program folder et voilà c'est en français ... ;-)
